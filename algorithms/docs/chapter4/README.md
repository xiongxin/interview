**Definition 4.1** An **abstract data type (ADT)** is a data type (a set of
values and a collection of operations on those values) that is accessed
only through an **interface**. We refer to a program that uses an ADT as a
client, and a program that specifies the data type as an **implementation**.

Definition 4.2 A pushdown stack is an ADT that comprises two
basic operations: insert (push) a new item, and delete (pop) the item
that was most recently inserted.
